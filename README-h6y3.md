# The Sensor Watch modifications by h6y3

This is my personal fork of the Sensor Watch repository.  Its purpose is mainly to maintain the watch faces and customizations I use on the Sensor Watch that are timer and productivity focused.

By default, I will be using:

- simple_clock_face
- preferences_face
- set_time_face

On the secondary index:

- finetune_face
- nanosec_face

Additions to the main clock are:

- timer_face
  - Defaults have been changed to:
    - 5 min
    - 10 min
    - 15 min
    - 30 min 
    - 45 min
    - 60 min
    - 75 min
- tomato_face
